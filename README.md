# Responsive-Webpage-Layout
This project demonstrates a responsive webpage layout built using HTML and CSS. The layout includes four main sections: header, sidebar, main content area, and footer. CSS Grid is used for desktop screens, while media queries ensure a smooth transition to a stacked layout on smaller devices.
